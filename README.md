# V2TDiff: Visible-to-Thermal Image Translation with Frequency-Modulated Diffusion Model
This repository contains the code associated with our paper "V2TDiff: Visible-to-Thermal Image Translation with Frequency-Modulated Diffusion Model". In this work, we propose a novel Frequency-Modulated Diffusion Model for translating visible images into their corresponding thermal infrared counterparts. Our approach leverages the power of diffusion models and introduces frequency modulation to improve the translation quality and capture fine-grained details between the visible and thermal domains.
